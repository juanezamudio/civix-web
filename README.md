Civix is a **civic engagement platform** designed to make it easier for citizens to access community resources, track local government spending, stay updated on civic events, and report local issues. Our mission is to empower citizens with the tools and information they need to better engage with their communities and local governments. 

## 🚀 Overview

Civix brings together the power of **real-time data retrieval** and **AI-powered insights** in a user-friendly platform to tackle various civic challenges. Whether you're looking for the nearest food bank, trying to understand where your tax dollars are going, or staying informed on upcoming city meetings, Civix is your go-to tool for civic involvement.

### Key Features

- **Resource Finder**: Quickly locate nearby food banks, shelters, clinics, and other community services with real-time availability.
- **Budget Tracker**: Explore local government spending with easy-to-understand visualizations and summaries.
- **Civic Events**: Get notified about town halls, public consultations, and other important community events near you.
- **Issue Reporting**: Report local problems like potholes, broken streetlights, and more, and track the status of your reports.

## 🧠 How It Works

Civix leverages a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** model to provide users with precise, contextualized information in real time. The platform combines:
- **Data Retrieval**: From open government APIs and community datasets to get real-time or static data on resources, spending, events, and more.
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Uses machine learning models (like GPT) to generate natural language responses that explain or summarize the data.

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, and Python for API integrations
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js for a smooth, responsive UI
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data, community resources, and reports
- **AI**: GPT-based model for generating natural language responses
- **Search/Indexing**: Elasticsearch for real-time data retrieval
- **APIs**: Open government APIs for budget data, resource availability, event information, and more

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

To get started with Civix on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16.x or higher
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (for running the AI model)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for database setup
- Open Civic APIs access (optional but recommended)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/civix.git
cd civix
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
For backend:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

For frontend:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in both `/server` and `/client` directories and add the following variables:

For the server (in `/server/.env`):
```bash
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/civix
AI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

For the client (in `/client/.env`):
```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 4: Start the Application

Start the backend server:
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

Start the frontend client:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`!

## 🤖 AI Integration

Civix integrates **AI-powered natural language generation** to convert raw data into human-friendly insights. The AI features allow Civix to:
- Summarize complex budget data into easy-to-read formats
- Provide conversational responses to user queries like "Where is the nearest food bank?"
- Offer personalized event recommendations based on location and preferences

### Example Query Flow
1. **User Input**: "Where's the nearest food bank?"
2. **Data Retrieval**: Civix retrieves the latest data on nearby food banks from public APIs.
3. **AI Generation**: The AI processes the raw data and generates a response like: 
   > "The nearest food bank is 2 miles away at [Address]. It's open today from 9 AM to 5 PM."
